        <img id="about" alt="Photo of Food" src="./assets/images/about.jpg">
        <p>Seneca Street, home to our flagship location, has been a home to our family for many years. The South Buffalo and Seneca Street community have been a great support for our family from the very beginning. That is why we made the deicision to open our first restaurant in our own community. Our goal was to serve the community that served us for years. Now, because of that support, we've been able to open three more locations here in Buffalo, and have been able to share our family's passion with those around us.</p>
